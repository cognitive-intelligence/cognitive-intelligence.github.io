# Universities and students

We have been working with universities and students for many years. We started at the Czech Technical University as COSE - Cognitive Security startup, before being acquired by Cisco in 2013. The character of our work requires continuous improvements. We have many engagements with universities here as well as other research institutions. Our large research team is working on new technologies to improve our threat detections. We need people with a strong theoretical background as well as AI, machine learning, and data processing skills. There are always interesting research topics and engineering tasks to work on.

Every year we propose some topics for MSc and BSc thesis for students. The collaboration with students typically starts with student projects. When both parties find the collaboration interesting, the student typically continues as a part-time Cisco employee. Many former students are now our colleagues at Cisco.

Generally, if one wants to finish the thesis with minimal effort, this would not be the right way to go. But if you want to work on an interesting and challenging task while learning practical skills, this would be a great start to your career!

Below is a list of the selected topics with short descriptions. The problem specifications are typically not carved into stone. They are meant to be a starting point for discussion. If the topic does not fit your set of skills exactly, or you do not understand its details, don't worry. Let us know and we'll put you in touch with the right person to discuss the details and find an alternate task which may fit you better.

What is the best set of skills? For starters, it's good to have programming experience, and it helps if you can process data. Any background in artificial intelligence, machine learning, or data science is also beneficial. Even then there will still be lots to learn. With the necessary enthusiasm and a will to learn, you should be able to learn quickly.

### Software engineering topics

<a name="ToolForAssistedEvaluation"></a>

##### Tool for assisted evaluation of security engine's efficacy

> Together with a team of data scientists, develop a tool that will improve their workflow for evaluation of security engine's results

### Research topics

<a name="Regexpgenerationfromexamples"></a>

##### Regexp generation from examples

> Regexp patterns are typically used to specify a pattern of URI indicating a particular threat type.
> Propose an algorithm of generating regexp based on examples and evaluate it with the existing data.

<a name="Learningfrommultimodaldatausinggraphbasedapproaches"></a>

##### Learning from multi-modal data using graph based approaches

> Learning and inference on graphs with nodes of different type (endpoints, servers, binaries, WhoIs entries, TOR nodes certification authorities, Autonomous systems,...) would provide a swiss-knife tool for 
> predictions from both static datasets (GFC) and different sources of telemetry (NetFlows, Web proxy logs, Email,...). The research might include exploring different types of encoding of the neighbor of the queried 
> node in the graph, constructing new classifiers that will directly operate on graphs/subgraphs, considering the temporal/time-series factor of telemetries, annotation of nodes/edges with additional parameters or new 
> sources of labels etc.

<a name="Networkassetdetectionandservicedescription"></a>

##### Network asset detection (and service description)

> Network asset discovery using destination IPs, URLs, argv etc. The main focus of the research is to reliably detect assets on telemetry that does not necessarily contain all of the communication and describe all of the services that are running on the asset.

<a name="Unsupervisedidentificationofsuspiciousdeviceactions"></a>

##### Unsupervised identification of suspicious device actions

[_Index of thesis_](#/students/Indexofthesis)

<a name="Recommendationsystemforsecurityalerts"></a>

##### Recommendation system for security alerts

[_Index of thesis_](#/students/Indexofthesis)

<a name="Selfsupervisedlearningincybersecurity"></a>

##### Self-supervised learning in cybersecurity

> Self-supervised approaches have taken the conventional ML fields by storm. In cybersecurity, however, it is still not clear how to use such approaches due to many inconvenient characteristics of the data. Explore the state-of-the-art methods in self-supervised learning and aim to apply them to some subproblem in cybersecurity.

<a name="Learningparametersofdetectorensemblefromdatawithlimitedlabels"></a>

##### Learning parameters of detector ensemble from data with limited labels

> Machine learning system contains multiple specialized detectors that need to be aggregated to produce final verdict of the system. This aggregation is currently performed by more or less manual process because of unavailability of labeled data to train the ensemble using supervised learning. In this thesis, we would explore how to introduce automation into the training process and utilize vast amount of unlabeled data to better tune the ensemble.
