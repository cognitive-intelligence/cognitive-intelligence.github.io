# Who we are and what we do

We are part of Cisco Security, one of the pillars of the Cisco portfolio. We belong to the Security Bussiness Group (SBG). Our team in Prague consists of more than 100 researchers, engineers, and data scientists. We are an international team collaborating with many colleagues around the world. 

We are developing complex systems for network cyber threat detection using machine learning and artificial intelligence. We build solutions for detecting threats in customer networks. We analyze network traffic of many millions of devices all over the world to detect suspicious behavior. The research and development process done by our team is end-to-end, from ideas and their prototypes to working products.We cooperate to invent, design, develop, and evaluate innovative models on very-large-scale data. We also design and implement scalable, efficient, and automated machine learning pipelines. We contribute our technology to several Cisco Security products.
  
We collaborate with many research institutions and universities here and abroad. We contribute to Cisco's patent portfolio and regularly publish at international conferences. Every year, we organize the Cisco Data Science Summit - a conference for data scientists and AI experts at Cisco.

### Where we are

Our Cisco offices are located in Prague, in the center of one of Europe’s most beautiful cities. Through our windows, we have a splendid view of the ancient Prague castle. The Vltava River is just a few steps away, and the old Czech Technical University building is across the street. Our [hi-tech offices](http://alesjungmann.cz/project/cisco/) are not just business-friendly, you can find a boulder room,  massage chair, and good coffee and tea in the kitchen. 

Cisco occupies two floors in the Charles Square Center. There is a supermarket, stationary store, café, bank, flower shop, post office, organic food shop, and gym - all located conveniently under one roof. If you are interested in learning more, please see the [history of Charles Square](http://www.nakupnigalerieatrium.cz/index.php/en/history).
