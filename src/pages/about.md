### Picture tour through our offices

Cisco Offices are located in Prague, in the center of one of Europe’s most beautiful cities. We have a splendid view of the ancient Prague castle just from the office windows. The the Vltava River is just few steps away and the old building of the Czech Technical University is cross the street. Our [hi-tech offices](http://alesjungmann.cz/project/cisco/) are not just bussiness friendly. You can find a bolder room there, massage chair or good coffee or tea in the kitchen. 
Cisco occupies two floors in the Charles Square Center. There is a supermarket, stationary store, café, bank, flower shop, post office, organic
food shop and gym all located conveniently under one roof. If you are interested in history of the place, please have a look [here](http://www.nakupnigalerieatrium.cz/index.php/en/history).
